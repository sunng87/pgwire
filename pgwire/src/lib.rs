//! # pgwire
//!
//! pgwire is library that implements postgresql wire protocol and allows to
//! write postgresql protocol compatible servers and clients. Of course in most
//! cases you don't need a custom client, `postgres-rust` will be work for
//! postgresql comptiable servers. So at the moment, this library focus on
//! server development.
//!
//! ## About Postgres Wire Protocol
//!
//! Postgres Wire Protocol is a relatively general-purpose Layer-7
//! protocol. There are 3 parts of the protocol:
//!
//! - Startup: client-server handshake and authentication.
//! - Simple Query: The legacy query protocol of postgresql. Query are provided
//! as string, and server is allowed to stream data in response.
//! - Extended Query: A new sub-protocol for query which has ability to cache
//! the query on server-side and reuse it with new parameters. The response part
//! is identical to Simple Query.
//!
//! Also note that Postgres Wire Protocol has no semantics about SQL, so
//! literally you can use any query language, data formats or even natural
//! language to interact with the backend.
//!
//! The response are always encoded as data row format. And there is a field
//! description as header of the data to describe its name, type and format.
//!
//! ## Components
//!
//! There are two main components in postgresql wire protocol: **startup** and
//! **query**. In **query**, there are two subprotocols: the legacy text-based
//! **simple query** and binary **extended query**.
//!
//! ## Layered API
//!
//! pgwire provides three layers of abstractions that allows you to compose your
//! application from any level of abstraction. They are:
//!
//! - Protocol layer: Just use message definitions and codecs in `messages`
//! module.
//! - Message handler layer: Implement `on_` prefixed methods in traits:
//!   - `StartupHandler`
//!   - `SimpleQueryHandler`
//!   - `ExtendedQueryHandler`
//! - High-level API layer
//!   - `AuthSource` and various authentication mechanisms
//!   - `do_` prefixed methods in handler traits
//!   - `QueryParser`/`PortalStore` for extended query support
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! [Examples](https://github.com/sunng87/pgwire) are provided to demo API
//! usages.
